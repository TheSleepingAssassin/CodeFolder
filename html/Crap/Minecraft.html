Minecraft is not a game all about breaking and placing blocks but a whole lot more than that people think of it as a boring, low graphical statistics having, not to do much in it, worst physics, and the list goes on and on. Remember what I said at the beginning of this criticising nonsense? I said that PEOPLE think of it that way not the minecrat pros, well you see, that Minecraft has though became very popular over the time but the criticising never ends, well I just have to say that those who speak of Minecraft as that that I told at the start<br>
(Wait a second I am just pasting it in)<br>
boring, low graphical statistics having, not to do much in it, worst physics(found it)<br>
This nonsene of jumbled words is by people categorized as insult but not for us mineraft pros, we and the whole minecraft community is very positive and thinks of that nonsense(please don't tell me to copy-paste that one more time)as not insult but some words in a language jumbled together.<br>
