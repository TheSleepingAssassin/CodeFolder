<h1>Football(Soccer)</h1>
<p>Football (the Soccer one) is a game that is played with 11 players in each team. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opponent team. There are fouls also like you cannot injure another player or like you cannot pull another players shirt etc. There are different cards like a yellow card which is issued for a warning also a red card which ends up to you getting automatic suspension from the match and you cannot replace yourself with a substitute. When you get a yellow card then you do another foul then you get the yellow card and the red card both at the same time. This is a diverse game that I know and love.</p>
