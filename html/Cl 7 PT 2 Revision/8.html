This is the Udaipur park and I don't remember it's name but there was a photoshoot shop in which they gave us Rajasthani clothes and told us to stand giving the pose that they told us, they edited it and we got our photos at the way to the exit, well inside the park was not much, just some roses, open fields, slides(which our mother didn't allow us to go on), just that but there was one more thing left. It was a train! It took all the people that sat into it to a tour of the whole park well when we got there unfortunately it was closed and we waited for a long time and then we asked a person then he informed us that the train station opens at 11:00 A.M., but then it was only 10:00 A.M. We were very sad that for the train we have to wait one hour and our mother told us to come along and visit other tourist places I asked my mother what to do about the train and she said that we would ride it afterwards I was happy on hearing that but I wanted to wait for a few more minutes as to thinking that the train driver would come I asked my mother about that and she allowed only 10 minutes and we waited the best thing of that was that I climbed over a wall and ngot to the other side and saw the train standing there alone, I saw it's track and was delighted by that much only and after that 10 minutes had been over and my mother told us to leave.<br>
There was not much to do in the park except the train
